[Isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism) 

in Sudoku Mathematics study a question that crops up frequently is:

  * How are two puzzles identical to each other? 

#Two puzzles are considered identical:

* If the digits of one puzzle are exchanged 1:1 

* There is 9!(362,880) possible changes for any singular grid for digit exchanges.

* So that when each cell is compared all 81 cells contain the same digit between both puzzles 

* Then it can be said puzzle A is isomorphic to puzzle B only by digit changes.

within this study a 2nd question appears [AutoMorphism](https://www.reddit.com/r/sudoku/wiki/index/automorphism/) how can two puzzles change to become the same puzzle.
