# [Depth First search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)  aka DFS
- Currently all previous chain topics focused on a specific type of A.i.C logic
 one direction paths: starting at a node and trans-versing it in sequence to the point of exhaustion.

This topic will cover a question that comes up occasionally: Bifurcation

## Bifurcation aka Branching or Path Fork
  - If a node that has multiple choices for path sequence 
       - Depth First evaluates one path at a time.
       - Breadth First evaluates all options before adding the next node.

#[Breadth fist search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) Aka BFS
 - the inference of each node is applied to all the possible next links befor exploring depth 

##Breadth first solving practices: 
  - A breadth first approach relies on visual aids to keep track of all the varying cells it is affecting as its transverse breadth and depth. 
  - Simple Colouring applies colour sequencing to Truths that are on, and another colour to those that are off for 1 candidate 
 - 3d Medusa applies colour sequence to truths that are on, and another colour to those that are off: and has different colours for candidate changes
 - Breadth first solving relies on puzzle construction rule contradictions expressed in colours for when to halt the search and apply eliminations.
