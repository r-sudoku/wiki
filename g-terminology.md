This Topic is a work in progress and will cover the final stage of chain building 

Everything up to this has covered starting from a Strong link; 

It is also possible to start from a Weak Link, the earliest forms of logic have deep roots in Forcing chains even a beginner uses forcing chains to "test" candidates as they learn and improve on skill sets.  

I list this topic last as it is arguably the strongest of the chaining methods 

However many feel these are "trial and error" approaches as your "testing" the first cell for truth. However, if your only applying reductions only you are still using logically sound constructs the choice is yours of what is or isn't logic in your eyes. 

#Weak link  implication chaining
  - using a specific weak link as a starting node in a chain sequence
  - unlike A.I.C, an Implication network can only be read in one direction. {left to right} 

#Nice Loops - Continuous & Discontinuations
 - A chain that can start on a weak link or a strong link and uses inferences on weak links or strong links to prove the starting weak link can only be false.

- These mimic A.I.C due to the use of strong links as a starting point
- They also mimic a.i.c's as the eliminations cells and the network also match a.i.c constructs
- More powerful then a.i.c as it can trigger a previously unavailable network as it applies a truth first and follows the changes 

#Forcing - Chains 
 - only uses Weak links while path searching follows directional one path at a time.  

#Forcing Nets
- uses breadth first search as it applies truths before adding the next link
