This topic is for condensing presentation of Fish 

Sometimes multiple fish have the same base sectors but a variation of cover sets 
these fish can be combined into one clean presentation, when combining them we add the words: Siamese in front of the fish type

# Siamese Fish 
* Siamese is a specialized characteristic and is listed first when naming 
* Alternatively a skyscraper may be called its name instead of a Siamese 

## Naming of Fish:
- listed in order
* 1. Specialized: Siamese 
* 2. Special Qualities: (endo)Finned or Sashimi
* 3. Shape : if non basic, and N > 1
* 4. Name for N size.

## Skyscraper - 2 Sashimi x-wings
* Example puzzle: 

..47.5...29....15..5891....52.49861....5.1...9.1.3..85..2856931..9...546..5149872

* Sashimi X-Wing: 6 c34 r25 fr6c4 => r5c5 <>6
* Sashimi X-Wing: 6 c34 r26 fr5c3 => r6c2<>6 

* Theses fish  represents a skyscraper
* To make it represent the eliminations more accurately we would combine them into 
a single written work,

### Result
* Siamese Sashimi X-Wing: 6 c34 r25/r26 fr6c4 fr5c3 => r5c5,r6c2<>6

##  2 - Sashimi sword fish 
* Example puzzle: 

..47.5...29....15..5891....52.49861....5.1...9.1.3..85..2856931..9...546..5149872

* Sashimi Swordfish: 7 r247 c239 fr7c1 => r8c2<>7
* Sashimi Swordfish: 7 r247 c139 fr7c2 => r8c1<>7

### Result 
* Siamese Sashimi Swordfish: 7 r247 c139/c239 fr7c2 fr7c1 => r8c12<>7



*Another method for compression fish presentation is when the same base & cover set also works for multiple digits 



# Muti-fish 
 - an identical fish base / cover that also applies to more then 1 digit 
 - Specialized characteristic name is used : Muti  
 - for these we combine the eliminations and listed starting digits

## Naming of Fish:
- listed in order
* 1. Specialized: Siamese, Muti 
* 2. Special Qualities: (endo)Finned or Sashimi
* 3. Shape : if non basic, and N > 1
* 4. Name for N size.

##  Muti Sashimi x-wing
* Example Puzzle

Sashimi X-Wing: 8 r24 c35 fr2c4 fr2c6 => r1c5<>8

Sashimi X-Wing: 9 r24 c35 fr2c4 fr2c6 => r1c5<>9

### Result 
 Muti Sashimi X-Wing: 8,9 r24 c35 fr2c4 fr2c6 => r1c5<>8,9
